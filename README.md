The automotive industry has been rapidly evolving over the past few
decades, with a growing focus on fuel efficiency, environmental
sustainability, and technological innovation. With increasing
competition among manufacturers and a changing consumer landscape,
it has become more important than ever to understand the factors that
drive consumer demand for cars.
In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards electric and
hybrid vehicles and increased interest in alternative fuel sources such as
hydrogen and natural gas. At the same time, traditional gasolineï¿¾powered cars remain dominant in the market, with varying fuel types

which car manufacturer is leading among the car companies, their
strategy to stand in the leading position. Based on the type of

can optimize their pricing, spends to increase the business, product
development decisions to maximize profitability while meeting
consumer demand.
